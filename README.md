VimRCG [VimRC Generator]
========================

VimRCG is an attempt to provide a ready-to-go VIM configuration that can be
downloaded via `curl`, `wget`, etc.

    $ curl http://vimrc.org/api/generate > ~/.vimrc; vim +PlugInstall +q

or, more simply:

    $ curl http://vimrc.download > ~/.vimrc; vim +PlugInstall +q

At the moment, the generated Vim configuration is a port of my existing 
Vim configuration, and may have several quirks and random mappings (maybe?).

The code was written over a weekend - for my brother who was having 
difficulties with Vim configuration. And, therefore, should be 
considered to be an alpha/unstable release at the moment. Several things 
may not work out on the `vimrc.org` website, or generated config may not 
work as expected. Although, I have tried to ensure such issues are 
minimal, expect inconsistencies till the time code for the website, and 
vim cofig is revisited.

This project hopes that the community will contribute in adapting the 
generated Vim configuration for general use, so that new users as well 
as experienced users can get started with VIM in a moment.

API Documentation
-----------------

### GET /generate

Generate VIM configuration with all bells and whistles. Response is `plain-text`
and can be downloaded via `curl`, `wget`, etc. to replace `~/.vimrc` file.

### GET /generate?only=sane_defaults,startup_screen

Generate a VIM configuration comprising of only the topics listed above.
Required topics like `variables`, `plugin_manager`, etc. are always returned, so
as to ensure that the generated VIM config is usable.

### GET /generate?exclude=macosx

This endpoint can be used when you want to exclude topics from the generated VIM
configuration, e.g. you may not want to include `macosx` topic in a vim config
solely being used on Linux systems. Or, in cases, when you may not want to
include a particular feature, like `startup_screen`.

### GET /topics.json

VIM configuration generated by `/generate` endpoint is broken into several
`topics`. You can grab a list of all such topics via this endpoint. Each topic
is accompanied with metadata, and sections.

A topic is identified via its name, or via an id. `/generate` endpoint uses
`id` to place them sequentially in the generated configuration.

A topic is, further, divided into `sections`. Section, here, is a granular unit
of vim config that provides a particular feature to the editor. Sections have
a list of features it provides, and the accompanying code.

### GET /topics.json?list=1

Return a JSON array of all topic names available.

### GET /topics.json?only=sane_defaults,macosx

Return a JSON comprising of only the topics listed above. Required topics likes
`variables`, etc. are not returned unless mentioned explicitely.

### GET /topics.json?exclude=sane_defaults,macosx

Return a JSON with all topics excluding the ones listed above. Required 
topics likes `variables`, etc. can also be filtered out.

### GET /sections.json?only=\<key\>

**INTERNAL API**

Return a JSON comprising of specific sections only. The `key` parameter is
calculated in a specific way:

- Calculate `section_id` for each section:
  
        # assuming we want to target 7th section in a topic
        section_id = "%05d" % (topic.index * 100 + 6)

- Join all such `section_id`s as a CSV string. This is the `key` parameter.

I am open to any suggestions that eases out requesting particular sections.
